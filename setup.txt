In order to set this up, all you have to do is.. run the file! 
I have this set up using some BAT and VBS files to have this start up in the background on startup, and have it gracefully exit on shutdown of the computer.
The graceful shutdown is by using the task scheduler to trigger exitProg.py, which initiates the shutdown process.
